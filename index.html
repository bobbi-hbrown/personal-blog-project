        A margarita is a cocktail consisting of tequila, orange liqueur, and lime juice often served with salt on the
        rim of the glass.
        <br>
        <br>
        The drink is served shaken with ice (on the rocks), blended with ice (frozen margarita), or without ice
        (straight up). Although it has become acceptable to serve a margarita in a wide variety of glass types, ranging
        from cocktail and wine glasses to pint glasses and even large schooners, the drink is traditionally served in
        the eponymous margarita glass, a stepped-diameter variant of a cocktail glass or champagne coupe.

        Easy to make and refreshingly bitter, the Negroni is said to have been invented in Florence by a dauntless
        Italian count who demanded that the bartender replace the club soda in his Americano with gin.
        In its hundred-year history, few cocktails have encouraged more frenzied experimentation than the beloved
        Negroni. Its one-to-one-to-one recipe of gin, Campari and sweet vermouth has become the platform on which
        generations of drink mixers have left their thumbprint.

        Mojito is a traditional Cuban highball. Traditionally, a mojito is a cocktail that consists of five ingredients:
        white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda water, and mint. Its combination of
        sweetness, citrus, and herbaceous mint flavors is intended to complement the rum, and has made the mojito a
        popular summer drink.
