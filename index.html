        <h2>Margarita</h2>
        <p>
            <b>A <em>margarita</em> is a cocktail consisting of tequila, orange liqueur, and lime juice often served with salt on the
                rim of the glass.</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            The drink is served shaken with ice (on the rocks), blended with ice (frozen margarita), or without ice
            (straight up). Although it has become acceptable to serve a margarita in a wide variety of glass types, ranging
            from cocktail and wine glasses to pint glasses and even large schooners, the drink is traditionally served in
            the eponymous margarita glass, a stepped-diameter variant of a cocktail glass or champagne coupe.

        <h2>Negroni</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Easy to make and refreshingly bitter, the <em>Negroni</em> is said to have been invented in Florence by a dauntless
                Italian count who demanded that the bartender replace the club soda in his Americano with gin.</b>
            In its hundred-year history, few cocktails have encouraged more frenzied experimentation than the beloved
            Negroni. Its one-to-one-to-one recipe of gin, Campari and sweet vermouth has become the platform on which
            generations of drink mixers have left their thumbprint.

        <h2>Mojito</h2>
        <p>
            <b><em>Mojito</em> is a traditional Cuban highball. Traditionally, a mojito is a cocktail that consists of five ingredients:
                white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda water, and mint.</b> Its combination of
            sweetness, citrus, and herbaceous mint flavors is intended to complement the rum, and has made the mojito a
            popular summer drink.
