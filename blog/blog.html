            <ol>
                <li> Sprinkle a few teaspoons of salt over the surface of a small plate or saucer. Rub one wedge of lime
                    along the rim of a tumbler and then dip it into the salt so that the entire rim is covered.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Fill a cocktail shaker with ice, then add the tequila, lime juice and triple sec. Shake until the
                    outside of the shaker feels cold.
                </li>


                <li>

                    Strain the mix into the prepared glass over fresh ice. Serve with a wedge of lime.
                </li>

            <ol>
                <li>Muddle the lime juice, sugar and mint leaves in a small jug, crushing the mint as you go â€“ you can
                    use the end of a rolling pin for this. Pour into a tall glass and add a handful of ice.
                </li>

                <li>Pour over the rum, stirring with a long-handled spoon. Top up with soda water, garnish with mint and
                    serve.
